## About Sujok Therapy üåø

Sujok Therapy is a natural healing approach rooted in acupressure principles. It utilizes the hands and feet, which mirror the entire body's active points, corresponding to all its organs and parts.

### Key Components of Sujok Therapy:
- **Hand-Foot Point Therapy**: Utilizes pressure points on the palms and soles to stimulate corresponding areas within the body.
- **Seed Therapy**: Involves the use of seeds to balance energy flow and promote healing.
- **Needle Therapy**: Uses needles to apply pressure at specific points for therapeutic effects.
- **Color Therapy**: Applies colors to specific areas to influence energy and promote wellness.
- **Moxa (Heat Therapy)**: Involves the application of heat to stimulate circulation and relieve pain.
- **Exercises**: Includes a variety of movements designed to enhance overall health and well-being.

Sujok therapy addresses four fundamental energy systems: the Meridian system, the Chakra system, the Spiral energy system, and the Diamond energy system. These systems work together to maintain the body's integral energy balance.
